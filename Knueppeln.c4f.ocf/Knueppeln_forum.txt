[h]ToDo (unsorted)[/h]

- Make some effects look better
- Better feedback of what spells do
- More sounds so every spell sounds different
- Do something on right click (preferably some sort of second melee attack - some people suggested a taunt menu)
- Different (team) game modes (I think Bomb-Run would be great)
- Special items (Maybe guest appearances from other packs if there were any(?). Caedes!)
- More maps
- Moar champions
- Maybe a system to ban champions / Limit them if there are too many some day
- Some sort of ghost cam for eliminated players that can do stuff. (can't put my concept into words)
- More decoration for the existing maps... where can i steal some?!
